# FJ Hotel Backend

FJ Hotel Backend is a comprehensive REST API for a hotel booking system built with **Spring Boot 3.5** and **Java 21**. The system provides room management, availability checking, user authentication, and booking functionality with support for both regular hotel rooms and meeting rooms across different categories (Standard, Deluxe, Suite). The backend uses **MySQL** for data persistence, **Spring Security** for authentication, **Spring Data JPA** for database operations, and includes a complete test suite with HTML test pages for API validation.
